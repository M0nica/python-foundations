For #6 (referring back to how Soma numbered the HW questions), you check your color function by running `violations_df['Vehicle Color'].head()` which then returns: 

        0     GREY
        1    WHITE
        3    WHITE
        4    BROWN
        6       GN
        
Based on your code, I don't think your color function capture the "GN" possibility, so you'd gave to revisit your function to handle that possibility.
