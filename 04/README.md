# Homework 4 - Navigating Data
Exploring Playlists and Artists in data collected from the Spotify API.

I found it challenging to navigate the structure of the data at some points since everything is nested in 'playlists' or 'artists'.

In future assignments, I may use more variables to store nested data in order to make it more clear which data I am working with instead of having to re-think the nested relationship. Also, it would be nice to be more familiar with the API in order to know how Spotify structures data and what certain varables mean.

It was helpful during this assignment to use .keys() in order to determine what type of information was/wasn't accessible from a particular variable. Additionally, it was helpful to print out the actual data in order to get a glimpse of the data structure --
Although, .keys() displayed a much more simplified version.
